# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## Description

This project was my employee tracker CLI application that was made by using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. This was a challenging project to complete because it is my first time using MySQL. I was able to successfully work through creating a database, seeding the information and then using JS to manipulate the data in the database. It was a very helpful project to complete to become more comfortable with databases and working with MySQL. This was also very helpful to continue to become more familiar with Javascript in general. Overall, I am very pleased with how this project turned out.

## Installation

To install this project you must first install NPM on your machine by running NPM install. Once installed you will login in to MySQL and first run the schema.sql and then the seeds.sql to create and seed the database. Once this is completed quit MySQL and run node server.js in the command line. There you will be prompted with several options to view and manipulate the employee datatbase.

## Usage
